# LADOT Transportation Planning Group - Parameterized Model for Active Transportation 

## About

The project creates a needs-driven transportation capital project scoring web map to help prioritize projects to advance for funding and implementation according to their relative advancement of City policy priorities (Safety, Access, Sustainability, etc.). This map could be based on [a web-map tool](https://ladcp.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=02d509dfe1ea458da1157b516249f4d9) DCP built for the [Great Streets Challenge](http://lagreatstreets.org/2016-challenge/) that helped to prioritize applications in accordance to policy priorities (MP 2035, Visions Zero, Plan for Healthy Los Angeles, etc.). LADOT is currently developing a project scoring web map that project managers will use to manually score their projects by a visual project overlay analysis. The Parameterized Model would advance the web map by automating the scoring process, based on project overlay with multiple map layers. This model could the project list developed [Active Transportation Planner](http://dsf.lacity.org/dot-active-transportation-planner) and expand to other LADOT/Public Works capital programs.

### How to add a new data layer on Geohub



### How to change the weight and total score with a new layer

To change the weight, the user has to be logged in with an administrative account.  On the right-side column of the web app, there is a button called 'Weights' underneath the title "Change scoring weights".  Click on the Weights button, 5 categories will appear and the user will be allowed to manually change weights for each of the given categories. Once the user is done changing weights of their chosen categories, the user will click the 'Submit' button so that the new weights are applied.

After the weights are changed, the user has to click 'Updated Scores' button so that the new weights are implemented in the new score.
